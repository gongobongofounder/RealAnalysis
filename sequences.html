            <b>&bullet; Infinitely Large Sequence:</b>

            <p>
                A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is called infinitely large if $ \forall K \in \mathbb{R}$ $\exists
                n_{k}
                \in
                \mathbb{N}$ such that $|a_n|>K$ $\forall n\geq n_k$.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Understanding What this means:</b>
                This means you have a sequence and you are going for larger and larger terms for example you
                have a
                sequence $\{a_n\}$ now, let's say you choose $2024 \in \mathbb{R}$ then as the sequence is
                getting
                larger and larger after a certain time you must find a term $a_N$ such that $a_N>2024.$ <br>
                Now, it may be two sided or one sided infinity as we go along the sequence and that is to
                say
                the
                sequence can either go to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ or both simultaneosly. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Why we need this?</b>
                You may wonder that wtf? We can simply say:
                $$\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=\infty$$
                But then why this kid of gargons?<br>
                The answer is tricky but simple concept of analysis that you must understand. <br>
                The reason is how you know what is infinity? This is not a number right! Do you know what
                number
                is
                infinity? Then how can you invoke it in mathematics? You cann't do any mathematical
                operations
                with
                it. Then you can't techmically write some real number $x=\infty$. This is wrong. That's why
                we
                need
                to bring the actual meaning of $\infty$ which is so large that we can't bound it by any real
                number
                say $K$. That's why this is said that $\nexists K \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\infty \leq K$
                or
                $\forall K \in \mathbb{R}$, $K>\infty$.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Velocity:</b>
                Lets define the velocity of a sequence by
                $$v=\frac{K}{n_K}$$
                <b>Example1:</b>
                Now, for the following sequence $\{a_n\}=\{1,2,3,4,5, \dots\}$ we have for any $K \in
                \mathbb{R}$, $n_K= \lfloor K \rfloor+1$. ( <a href="">Verify</a> ). <br>
                Now, $v=\frac{K}{\lfloor K \rfloor+1}$.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b> Example2: </b>
                Consider the sequence:
                $$
                a_1=1 \\
                a_2=1+ \frac{1}{2} \\
                a_3=1+ \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3} \\
                a_4=1+ \frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\\
                \vdots \\
                a_n=1+ \frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}+ \dots +\frac{1}{n}\\
                $$
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Velocity Calculation:</b>
                Observe that,
                $$a_n=1+ \frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}+ \dots +\frac{1}{n} =1+ (\frac{1}{2})
                +(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4})+ \dots +\frac{1}{n}\\ >1+
                \frac{1}{2}+(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4})+\dots + \frac{1}{n}\\
                =1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\dots+\frac{1}{n}$$
                So, for $K \in \mathbb{R}$ we need $n_K\geq2^{K}$. <br>
                Then $v\leq \frac{K}{2^K}$
            </p>

            <p>Now, compare $v_1=\frac{K}{\lfloor K \rfloor+1}$ and $v_2\leq \frac{K}{2^K}$ <br>

                Cleraly, $v_1>>v_2$. <br>

                <b>Moral:</b>
                $v_2 << v_1$ but it is steady, so gradually it blows to $\infty$. </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Definition:</b>
                A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is called cauchy iff $\forall \varepsilon>0$, $\exists K \in
                \mathbb{N}$
                such that $\forall m,n \geq K$ <br>$|a_n-a_m|<\varepsilon$. </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Notice:</b>
                        If we fix $m=K$ then $|a_n-a_K|<\varepsilon$ $\forall n\geq K$. <br>
                            This implies that cauchy sequence is bounded.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Also Notice: Cauchy sequence cann't oscillate.</b> <br>
                        <b>Proof:</b>
                        Let $\{a_n\}$ be a cauchy sequence. Now, let it be oscillatory(If possible). Now, let
                        $\{a_{n_k}\}$ be a convergent subsequence of $\{a_n\}$. Then we have,
                        $$\lim_{k \to \infty}a_{n_k}=l$$
                        <br>
                        then by definiton of limit, for $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ we have a $N_1 \in \mathbb{N}$
                        such that <br>
                        $\forall n_k \geq N_1 \implies$ $|a_{n_k}-l|<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$....(1) </p>

                            <p>
                                As $\{a_n\}$ is cauchy, we have a $N_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that <br> $\forall
                                m,n\geq N_2 \implies |a_m-a_n|<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.......(2) </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Consider $max\{N_1,N_2\}=N$, then equation (1) and (2) holds togethre,
                                        and
                                        giving us something interesting. <br>
                                        We can think $m=n_k$ now and can say $\forall n_k and n \geq N$ we have,
                                        $|a_{n_k}-a_n|<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. Now, adding This with equation
                                            (1) we get $|a_{n_k}-l|+|a_{n_k}-a_n|<\varepsilon$. <br>

                                            By triangluar inequality we get, <br>
                                            $$|a_n-l| \leq |a_{n_k}-l|+|a_{n_k}-a_n|<\varepsilon$$ And here we
                                                get by definiton of limit $$\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=l$$ </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    So, moral is oscillation simply means convergence and cauchy
                                                    sequence can't diverge. Together we get, only way a cauchy
                                                    sequence can't converge is the point of convergence is not
                                                    inside the set.
